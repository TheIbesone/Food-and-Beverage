## RECOMMENDATIONS
From the dashboard, it is evident that the Retail sales channel generated the highest revenue. this highlights the need to:
-	Recruit competent social media marketers for the sales chaneel. In the 4th quarter, despite __4,415__ Orders being requested, only __1.06M__ revenue was generated, unlike previous quarter where __4,132__ orders resulted in __1.09M__ revenue. The social media space holds a lot of potentials and should be harnessed.
-	Professional who can sale DRINKS should be employed as well because the total revenue of drink compared to food is very low. To stay healthy and hydrated, we need more drink options. Improving sales in this platform can be achieved by focusing on drink sales. üçπüòÉ
